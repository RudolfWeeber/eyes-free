#summary FAQs for users of eyes-free applications

= Introduction =

There's far more code than documentation, so here's an attempt to provide some general answers to some of the questions we've received. These answers are aimed at the end-users of the applications. Developer FAQs to follow.

== Loading the eyes-free shell automatically on Android ==
The eyes-free-config application allows you to configure your device so the eyes-free-shell will load automatically when your phone turns on. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the Market.

The 'home' button will then go to the eyes-free shell. If you want to return to the default, graphical shell, press and hold the 'back' key for a long time (about 6 seconds should be enough).

== Bootstrapping the text-to-speech applications ==
To work, the applications need the text-to-speech library installed and the speech data. These can be downloaded from Market if they're not already installed.
