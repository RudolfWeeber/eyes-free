#summary Tips on downloading and using the Android SDK.

= Introduction =

The Android SDK is intended mostly for programmers who want to develop Android applications, but it's also useful for a couple of other things:

  # It includes a complete phone emulator, so you can try out Android software without a phone, and
  # It gives you shell access to your phone, so you can install software and execute certain commands using your computer's terminal, even though your phone may not be fully accessible to you.

= Details =

Please note that the SDK is quite large (over 20 MB), and the tools assume a basic familiarity with the command line.

The SDK can be found at http://developer.android.com/sdk, but for your convenience, here are direct links to the SDK for three platforms:

  * Linux: http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r04-linux_86.tgz
  * Windows: http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r04-windows.zip
  * Mac: http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r04-mac_86.zip

In the "tools" directory, you'll find a program called "emulator".  Run it from the command line with no options to get some options.
