This directory contains an example of how to define a TTS provider.

This examples consists of two parts.
The native code part, which resides in Application.mk and project/...,
must be built with the Android NDK:

   unzip android-ndk-1.6_r1.zip
   cd android-ndk-1.6_r1

   cd apps
   ln -s ../../eyes-free/PlaceHolderTTSEngine PlaceHolderTTSEngine
   cd ..

   # Bug work-around: change "==" to "=" in line 119 of build/host-setup.sh
   sed -i.bak 's/"$result" == "Pass"/"$result" = "Pass"/' build/host-setup.sh

   ./build/host-setup.sh

   make APP=PlaceHolderTTSEngine

This will generate a file

   project/libs/armeabi/libPlaceHolderTTSEngine.so

which should be copied to

   libs/armeabi/libttsplaceholder.so

The Java part, which resides in AndroidManifest.xml and in src/...,
must be built according to the instructions in ../README.
