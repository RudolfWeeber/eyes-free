      <span dir="ltr">Utilizing Android Accessibility APIs to Provide
      Alternative and Complementary UI Feedback</span></h3>
      <h2><b>Objective/Description:</b></h2>
      This code lab demonstrates how to use the <a
        href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/package-summary.html"
        target="_blank">Android accessibility APIs</a> to write an <a
        href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService.html"
        target="_blank">accessibility service</a> that provides custom feedback
      for the Clock application which comes with Android devices. At the end of
      this exercise, you will have built "ClockBack" which handles only <a
        href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityEvent.html"
        target="_blank">accessibility events</a> from a specific package,
      changes the provided feedback type based on the device state, utilizes
      application domain knowledge to enhance the spoken feedback, and
      demonstrates how the accessibility APIs can be utilized to provide both
      alternative and complementary UI feedback.<br />
      <h2><b>Requirements:</b></h2>
      The requirements for this codelab is a basic understanding of Android. You
      should have your <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html"
        target="_blank">Android development environment setup</a> and understand
      the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html"
        target="_blank">basic concepts</a> of Android development. If you are
      unfamiliar with Android, we highly recommend that you look at the <a
        href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android
      developer website</a> and familiarize yourself with developing on Android by
      trying out the <a
        href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/index.html"
        target="_blank">code samples</a> there.<br />
      <h2><b><b>Background:</b></b></h2>
      The accessibility APIs are light-weight with no performance impact if
      accessibility is disabled and are available since release 1.6 of the
      Android platform. On Android devices each application runs in a separate
      process. Hence, the applications a user is interacting with and the
      accessibility services which provide feedback based on that user's actions
      run in separate processes.<br />
      <br />
      Therefore, to propagate the information of user interactions to interested
      accessibility services the Android UI layer is instrumented to fire
      accessibility events if something interesting happens (say clicking a
      button). These events are dispatched by the system to the accessibility
      services which are registered as such and managed by the system. Enabling
      or disabling an accessibility service happens only upon an explicit user
      action in the settings menu.<br />
      <br />
      Accessibility services send an<a
        href="http://raventhorn.is-into-anime.com/webshare/Drivers/Motorola%20Cell/android-sdk-windows/docs/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityServiceInfo.html"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> accessibility service info</a> to the
      system with information about how they would like to be handled. An
      accessibility service can provide a specific feedback type and the system
      invokes only one accessibility service per feedback type, thus avoiding
      two accessibility services speaking at the same time. Android devices come
      with three accessibility services: TalkBack - provides spoken feedback;
      KickBack - provides haptic feedback; SoundBack - provides audible
      feedback. <br />
      <h2><b>Code-Walk</b>:</h2>
      <h3>I. Introduction</h3>
      This code-walk guides you through the process of building an accessibility
      service which utilizes all the features of the Android accessibility APIs.
      The exercise is organized in small, incremental steps each exploring a new
      dimension of functionality that allows you to enhance a provided feedback
      type as well as to enrich the palette of provided feedback types. The
      code-walk also gives an example of using the platform APIs to obtain
      deveice state information and use it to dynamically change the provided
      feedback. Each step leads you to a running version of "ClockBack",
      therefore you can go through the process of refining the alternatice and
      complementary feedback.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Note</b>: Each of the steps in this code-walk provides a URL to a SVN
      revision at Google Code. While the code is commented in detail, each
      revision has review comments which provide a higher level perspective.
      Since there is rarely a best solution in programming we encourage you to
      not only try writing the code of each step yourself but also to explore
      ways of achieving the goals in more optimal and original manner.<br />
      <h3> II. Create an Eclipse project form SVN:<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Create an Eclipse project from SVN:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install <a
          href="http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/downloads.php" target="_blank"
          rel="nofollow">Subversive</a>.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Create a new Eclipse project form SVN using as a repository URL
        (no user name and password needed):
        http://eyes-free.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/ClockBackTutorial/Step-By-Step</li>
        <li>Press "Next" and then "Finish" (Click "Date" and then "Head
        Revision" to make "Finish" enabled - looks like a minor bug).</li>
        <li>Select "Checkout as a project configured using the New Project
        Wizard" and select "Finish"<br />
        </li>
        <li>Select "Android"-&gt;"Android project" and press "Next"</li>
        <li>Enter "ClockBack" as the "Project name" and "Application name".</li>
        <li>Select "Android 1.6" for "Build Target."</li>
        <li>Enter "com.google.android.marvin.clockback" as "Package name".<br />
        </li>
        <li>Uncheck "Create Activity".</li>
        <li>Enter "4" as "Min SDK Version" and press "Finish".</li>
        <li>Right click on the project, select "Team"-&gt;"Synchronize with
        repository" (For some reason Eclipse does not create the project with
        all the SVN data).<br />
        </li>
        <li>Right click on the project, select "Override and update..." and
        press "Yes"</li>
        <li>Go back to the "Java" perspective go to "Project"-&gt;"Android"
        and select "Android 1.6" (While forcing the update Eclipse forgot our
        configuration).</li>
        <li>Clean you project and you are ready to go :)<br />
        </li>

      <h3>III. Step 0 - spoken feedback
      for the Clock application<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Update to revision:</b> 574 and visit <a

      review comments.<b><br />
      <br />
      Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to write a basic
      accessibility service which provides spoken feedback for a specific
      application.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Enable accessibility:
        Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Accessibility.</li>
        <li>Enable "ClockBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;ClockBack.</li>
        <li>Poke around <u>with the track ball</u> and then go to and
        explore the Clock application.</li>
        <li>Try to change the time of an alarm and visit the plus and minus
        buttons and the hour and minute input fields.</li>
      </ol>
      <b>What to expect</b>: Spoken feedback is provided only for the Clock
      application. However, the plus and minus buttons are not spoken and the
      hour and minute input fields are not announced as such.<br />
      <h3> IV. Step 1
      - enhance the spoken feedback for the Clock application with domain
      knowledge<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Update to revision:</b> 575 and visit <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/source/detail?r=575"
        target="_blank">the revision URL</a> to see the code delta and read the
      review comments.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to enhance the spoken
      feedback utilizing domain knowledge. As a result we are properly
      announcing the plus and minus buttons and the hour and minute input fields
      in the edit alarm dialog.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Enable accessibility:
        Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Accessibility.</li>
        <li>Enable "ClockBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;ClockBack.</li>
        <li>Try to change the time of an alarm and visit the plus and minus
        buttons and the hour and minute input fields.</li>
      </ol>
      <b>What to expect</b>: The plus and minus buttons and the hour and minute
      fields are properly spoken.<br />
      <h3> V. Step 2
      - enhance the spoken feedback by announcing context changes - screen
      on/off<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Update to revision:</b> 576 and visit <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/source/detail?r=576"
        target="_blank">the revision URL</a> to see the code delta and read the
      review comments.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to enhance the spoken
      feedback by announcing context changes, in our case the screen on/off
      events.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Press the Power button on the device to turn the screen on and
        off</li>
      </ol>
      <b>Note:</b> The screen on/off announcement is enabled for all
      applications since the default accessibility service that provides spoken
      feedback TalkBack (the version we were developing against) was lacking
      (the latest TalkBack provides such feedback) this feature.<br />
      <br />
      <b>What to expect</b>: The screen on and off events are announced
      including the ringer volume.<br />
      <h4><a name="TOC-2.-Create-a-simple-UI-to-show-what-"></a></h4>
      <h3> VI. Step 3
      - adding audible feedback to announce ringer mode changes<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Update to revision:</b> 577 and visit <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/source/detail?r=577"
        target="_blank">the revision URL</a> to see the code delta and read the
      review comments.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to enhance the spoken
      feedback by announcing changes in the ringer mode (normal/vibrate/silent).<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Use the ringer volume keys to change the ringer mode.<br />
        </li>
      </ol>
      <b>Note:</b> The audible feedback for ringer mode change is enabled for
      all applications since the default accessibility support (at the time we
      were developing) does not provide such.<br />
      <br />
      <b>What to expect</b>: A ringer mode specific earcon (short sound) is
      played upon switching to a given ringer mode.<br />
      <h3> VII. Step
      4 - providing spoken feedback for normal ringer mode and auditory feedback
      for other ringer modes<br />
      </h3>
      <b>Update to revision:</b> 578 and visit <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/source/detail?r=578"
        target="_blank">the revision URL</a> to see the code delta and read the
      review comments.<br />

      <br />
      <b>Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to dynamically change
      the provided feedback type depending on the ringer mode.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Enable accessibility:
        Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Accessibility.</li>
        <li>Enable "ClockBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;ClockBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;TalkBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkKick": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;KickBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkSound": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;SoundBack.</li>
        <li>Make sure you ringer mode is normal (ringer volume not zero).</li>
        <li>Poke around in the Clock application.</li>
        <li>Change the ringer volume to either vibrate or silent.</li>
        <li>Poke around in the Clock application.</li>
        <li>Poke around outside of the Clock application.</li>
      </ol>

      <b>Note:</b> Make sure you start accessibility services in the specified
      order (application specific ones i.e. ClockBack first). Beginning from the
      next Android release the default accessibility services will be invoked as
      fall-back in case no application specific ones exist and the oder of
      starting services will be irrelevant. <br />
      <br />
      <b>What to expect</b>: When the ringer mode is normal the feedback in the
      Clock application is spoken enhanced with domain knowledge (try the change
      alarm time dialog) and for other ringer modes the feedback is auditory
      (complementing the visual). However, going outside the application we
      receive the system wide default feedback.<br />
      <h3> VIII. Step
      5 - providing spoken feedback for normal ringer mode, auditory feedback
      for vibrate ringer mode, and haptic feedback for ringer silent mode<br />
      </h3>

      review comments.<br />
      <br />

      <b>Step description:</b> This step demonstrates how to dynamically change
      the ringer mode depending on the context and use haptic feedback for the
      silent ringer mode.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to try:</b><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Install "ClockBack" on the device.</li>
        <li>Enable accessibility:
        Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Accessibility.</li>
        <li>Enable "ClockBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;ClockBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkBack": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;TalkBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkKick": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;KickBack.</li>
        <li>Enable "TalkSound": Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;SoundBack.</li>
        <li>Make sure you ringer mode is normal (ringer volume not zero).</li>
        <li>Poke around in the Clock application.</li>
        <li>Change the ringer volume to vibrate.</li>
        <li>Poke around in the Clock application.</li>
        <li>Change the ringer volume to silent.</li>
        <li>Poke around in the Clock application.</li>
      </ol>

      <b>Note:</b> Make sure you start accessibility services in the specified
      order (application specific i.e. ClockBack first). Beginning from the next
      Android release the default accessibility services will be invoked as
      fall-back in case no applciation specific ones exist and the oder of
      starting services will be irrelevant. <br />
      <br />
      <b>What to expect</b>: When the ringer mode is normal the feedback in the
      Clock application is spoken enhanced with domain knowledge (try the change
      alarm time dialog). If the ringer mode is vibrate the provided feedback is
      auditory and for ringer mode silent the feedback is haptic.<br />
