* Introduction

This directory contains source code for various eyes-free
applications for the Android platform --- see
[[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/04blind.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=business][For
The Blind, Technology Does What A Guide Dog Can't]], NYTimes,
January 4, 2009. It will also contain supporting code and
libraries for services such as Text-To-Speech
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis][(TTS)]].

[[http://www.youtube.com/eyesfreeandroid][For demos of various Eyes-Free 
projects, please visit our YouTube Channel.]]

Or better yet, go to Android Market on your G1 and try these apps out for
yourself.

* Initial Setup

1. [[http://developer.android.com/][Download and setup the Android SDK.]]

2. [[http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/source/checkout][Checkout the source 
   code for the Eyes-Free project.]]

3. If you are building with Eclipse:
   - File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace.
   - With "Select root directory:" selected, browse to the root of your SVN
     directory.
   - Select the Eyes-Free projects you wish to import into your Workspace.
   - Click Finish.
   - For each of the projects, right click, Properties > Java Build Path >
     Libraries and then fix any broken paths by pointing them at the
     "commonlibs" directory.

   If you are building with Ant:
   - Go to the "tools" subdirectory of the Android SDK.
   - For each project you wish to build, run this command:
     :android update project --path /path/to/fooproject --target 1



* Build Instructions

If you are building with Eclipse:
These projects are built like any other Android project. Hit the run button,
choose "Android Application" in the "Run As" screen, and you're done.

If you are building with Ant:
Each of these eyes-free applications can be built with a simple command-line
of the form:

:ant <build type>

where <build type> is "debug", "release", "install", "reinstall", or 
"uninstall" without quotes.

The most common types are "reinstall" (build with debug key and automatically
install on your device/emulator, overwriting any older version that may exist)
and "release" (build an unsigned apk which you can sign with your own key and
put on Market).

Thus, to build the Talking Dialer and automatically install it, 
: cd talkingdialer
: ant reinstall
