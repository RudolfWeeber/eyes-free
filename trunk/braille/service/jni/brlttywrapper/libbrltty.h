 * This is a library to expose a brlapi-like interface that can be linked
 * into another binary.  The intended use is on Android, compiled under
 * the NDK, meaning that some system and I/O abstractons must be
 * provided by the user of the library.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * All this must be called from one and only one thread from initialization to
 * destruction.  There is global state maintianed by this library internally,
 * meaning there can only be one driver active at a time.  This is why there
 * is no 'handle' object for the driver.  Each initialization call should be
 * followed at some point by a matching destroy call.
