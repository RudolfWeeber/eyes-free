Braille Key Mapping Tables And Android
======================================

The keyboard mapping for the supported braille displays are extracted from the
brltty source code, modified according to a patch in this directory and then
archived in a zip file.  This zip archive is included as a raw resource in the
Android package and extracted at run-time by the Braille Display service.


Generating The Tables
---------------------

The zip file can be generated and put in the correct location by the
mkkeytables.sh shell script.  Just run the script like so:

$ tables/mkkeytables.sh

...
Keyboard table archive successfully created.


Updating The Tables
-------------------

To update the keyboard mappings, you need to do the following:

* Generate the zip archive as described above if it doesn't already
  exist.

* Unzip the archive into a temporary directory:

$ mkdir mytables
$ (cd mytables && unzip ../res/raw/keytables.zip)

* Update the tables as required.

* Update the zip file in the resource directory:

$ zip -j -r res/raw/keytables.zip mytables

To generate the key table patch from a modified directory as per above:

* Get rid of any backup files so they don't get included in the patch.

* Generate the diff:

$ diff -Pu jni/brlttywrapper/brltty/Tables mytables \
  |egrep -v "^Only in " \
  > tables/keytables.diff

* If you have added files from the brltty sources, make sure to add them to
  tablefiles variable in the mkkeytables.sh script.


BRLTTY To Android Key Mappings
------------------------------

The set of commands on Android is slightly different form what is available in
the BRLTTY built-in command set.  Many commands, however, have a reasonable
mapping, which allows most of the mapping tables to be reused on Android.  For
the definitive list of mappings, see the file
jni/brlttywrapper/BrlttyWrapper.c.  Look for the function initCommandTables.
