    <h1>RockLock Tutorial</h1>

    <p>RockLock is a music player that can double as a lock
    screen. All of the music player controls are gesture-driven
    using linear gestures along the 8 compass directions. This
    tutorial defines the various gestures for each screen in
    RockLock. Throughout this tutorial, we'll denote the gestures
    using the numeric phone-keypad; thus, <em>phone-keypad 1</em>
    means you stroke diagonally up and to the left.</p>

    <h2>RockLock Music Player Screen</h2>
    <p>You can start or stop playing the <em>current</em>  track
    by tapping anywhere on the screen.
On the main music player screen, you can swipe <b>left</b>
    and <b>right</b> to navigate between tracks;
    i.e. phone-keypad <em>4</em> and <em>6</em>. You can swipe
    <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> (i.e., phone-keypad <em>2</em> and
    <em>8</em>) to navigate between Artists, Albums, Genres,
    Playlists, etc. depending on your current navigation mode. By
    default, completing these gestures with one finger will
    automatically update the playing track. If you instead use
    two fingers, you can browse tracks without changing the
    current track, and tap when you are ready to play your new
    track. You can switch to single-finger browsing via the
    RockLock settings screen.</p>

    <p>RockLock supports six distinct navigation modes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Artists</b>: Navigate between artists and albums within
      artists.</li>
      <li>

        <b>Directories</b>: Descend into and up

    <p>You can switch between the various modes by swiping
    <em>phone-keypad 3</em> to go to the next mode and
    <em>phone-keypad 7</em> to go to the previous mode. Below is
