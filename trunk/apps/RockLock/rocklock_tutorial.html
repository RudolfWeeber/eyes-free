<h1>RockLock Tutorial</h1>

<p>RockLock is a music player that can double as a lock screen. All of the music player controls are gesture-driven using linear gestures along the 8 compass directions. This tutorial defines the various gestures for each screen in RockLock.</p>

You can swipe <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> to navigate between Artists, Albums, Genres, Playlists, etc. depending on your current navigation mode. By default, completing these gestures will one finger will automatically update the playing track. If you instead use two fingers, you can browse tracks without changing the current track, and tap when you are ready to play your new track.
