<p>
While the experience is largely the same on most Android phones, each new version of Android
starting with version 1.6 has added new accessibility features. This is a guide to which
features were introduced in each version, which might be helpful in deciding whether to purchase
a phone with a particular Android version.
</p>

<h2>Android 1.6 "Donut"</h2>

<ul>
<li>First version to support Accessibility. Comes with Pico TTS engine.
<li>Some talking apps can use alternative speech engines if you install
    TTS Extended, but Loquendo voices are not compatible.
</ul>

<h2>Android 2.1 "Eclair"</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some talking apps can use the Loquendo TTS engine.
</ul>

<h2>Android 2.2 "Froyo"</h2>

<ul>
<li>Support for alternative TTS engines is built-in. All talking apps
    can use Pico, Espeak, Loquendo, or other speech engines.
<li>Accessibility Settings adds a new option, Power button ends call,
    so that you don't need to find an End Call button on the touch screen
    to hang up.
</ul>
