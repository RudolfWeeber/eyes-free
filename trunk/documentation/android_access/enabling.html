<p>
Currently if you have no vision you will be unable to access a
brand-new Android phone without sighted assistance. Luckily, once you
enable accessibility the first time, your phone will remember this
setting and you'll be able to do everything else yourself.
</p>
<p>
If you have a brand-new Android phone, here are the instructions for
enabling accessibility:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>If the phone is asking you for a Google Account or it's in the
  system tutorial mode, press the button to skip it and do it
  later.</li>

  <li>Press the Menu button. Every Android phone has a Menu button on
  the front, you shouldn't have to open the keyboard here.</li>

  <li>Press Settings.</li>

  <li>Open Text-To-Speech settings (it might be inside "Voice input &
  output settings"). Click "Listen to an example". If it doesn't play,
  try clicking "Install voice data", below.</li>

  <li>Go back to the main Settings screen and open Accessibility settings.</li>

  <li>Press the checkbox next to Accessibility. Say OK to the alert
  asking if you're sure you want to do this.</li>

  <li>Press the checkbox next to TalkBack. Say OK to the alert.</li>

  <li>Also recommended: Press the checkbox next to KickBack. Say OK to
  the alert. KickBack just gives you haptic feedback using the phone's
  vibrational motor, it's especially useful when you do need to
  occasionally use the touch screen.</li>

</ol>

<p>
Now just wait a few seconds and your phone will start talking when you
press an arrow key. If you still need to set up your Google account,
do this now in the About section of Settings.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of other settings that are useful for accessibility,
in the Sounds (or Sounds & Display) section of the Settings: Haptic
Feedback and Audible Selection. Both of those provide additional feedback
when performing certain actions.
