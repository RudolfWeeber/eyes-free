<p>
One of the best things about Android is that almost everything is
customizable. This is something that all users can enjoy, but it's
particularly helpful for accessibility, because just about anything on
the phone that's inaccessible or not fully accessible can be replaced
by another app that's more accessible.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the types of apps that you might want to install, and
some examples of particular apps to search for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Voices</strong>: the voice that comes with Android is
    based on the SVOX Pico engine, but you're not limited to using
    just that one. There are currently two other choices on the
    market. Espeak is another free voice. It sounds a little unusual,
    but it's free, fast, and supports dozens of languages. In
    addition, there's a commercial voice from Loquendo, called
    Susan. Just search for either Susan or Loquendo on the
    Market. While it's not free, it's not very expensive and the
    quality is very good. Installing a voice requires a couple of
    extra steps that a normal app doesn't require: first open the app
    to download any voice data and finish the installation, then open
    Settings and enable the voice you want to use.
    <p>
    If you have Android 2.1 or earlier, you can install TTS
    Extended, which allows apps to have all of the TTS capabilities of
    Android 2.2. It won't do anything by itself, but some talking apps
    might require it or give you more speech options if you have it
    installed. You don't need it if you're running Android 2.2 or
    higher.</li>

  <li><strong>Accessibility Tools</strong>: Your Android device probably
    came with a version of TalkBack pre-installed. However, TalkBack is
    under active development, and if you want the latest features, you
    should download TalkBack from the Market. Once you download the Market
    version of TalkBack, the Market will automatically notify you when new
    versions are available, from then on.  Note that TalkBack cannot be
    uninstalled.
    <p>
    In addition, there's another screen reader available,
    called Spiel. Currently Spiel is not available on the Market, but
    you can download it directly by searching for the URL
    http://tinyurl.com/aspiel from the home screen. While the url will
    load in the Browser, which is not accessible, it will
    automatically download the app and you can install it by going to
    your Notifications screen. You can have both TalkBack and Spiel
    installed at the same time, and then enable whichever one you want
    to use. It's perfectly safe to have both of them enabled, but only
    one of them will actually work at a time. Spiel and TalkBack work
    very much the same way, so you shouldn't expect major
    differences. They're both being actively developed independently,
    and they both have their strengths and weaknesses.

  <li><strong>Screen lock</strong>: If you don't like swiping across
    the screen, you can install applications that eliminate the need
    to do a gesture in order to unlock the screen, or replace it with
    a separate lock screen requiring a password. Two Market apps to
    get you started: "No Lock" is a simple app with a single checkbox
    - checked to require unlocking the screen with a swipe, unchecked
    to not require it. "Rock Lock" is a screen that lets you listen to
    music while the phone is locked. It also makes a great music
    player! Search the market for other lock screens!

  <li><strong>Home screen</strong>: The Eyes-free shell is a home
    screen designed to be used without looking at the screen. It uses
    an innovative touch-screen input method that lets you access a lot
    of functionality without being able to see the screen, but without
    needing to first open your keyboard. Press and hold your finger
    near the center of the screen, then pretend you're in the center
    of a 3 x 3 grid of squares. Move your finger to each of the 9
    cells in the square and listen to what each one is, then release
    your finger when you find something you want. It installs a
    separate app called Shortcuts Manager for Eyes-Free Shell that
    lets you customize it.

    Eyes-free Android apps, see

  <li><strong>Email</strong>: currently there's one accessible
    email program, called 
    <a href="http://apps4android.org/k9.htm">IDEAL Accessible K9 mail</a>.
    </li>

  <li><strong>Web</strong>: For more information on how to browse the
    web with Android, see
