One of the most important apps is the Android Market, which gives you
access to a collection of more than 70,000 free and paid apps for you to
download with just a few clicks. On Android, software installation is
almost always done using the phone directly, rather than via a computer.
The easiest way to install apps is from the Market, but at the bottom of
this page is a note about non-Market apps.
</p>
<p>
While there are a couple of parts of the Android Market that are not
completely accessible yet, it's completely usable once you learn
how it works.
</p>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p>
To begin, find the app called Market in the application launcher and click
on it to open it.
</p>
<p>
The first time the Market opens, the initial screen is a terms of service
agreement that you must agree to. You'll hear "Android Market Terms of
Service". The terms of service are in an inaccessible web view, but 
if you press Down enough times, you'll eventually reach the bottom, where
you'll find Accept and Reject buttons to the left and right of each other.
Find Accept and click.
</p>

<div class="note">
If you would like to read the Android market terms of service so you know
what you're agreeing to on your phone, you can find them here:
<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/android/market-tos.html"
>Android Market Terms of Service</a>.
</div>

<p>
There are two ways to find applications on the market, by searching or by
browsing. When you open the Market the first time, you'll be in a browse
screen with one or more categories across the top, like <strong>Games</strong>,
and a vertical list of some apps below that. If you press Menu, you'll find
options to initiate a search or go to the list of Downloads, which are apps
you've already downloaded from the Market - so you can update or uninstall
them.
</p>

<p>
To search for a particular app, click Search from the menu or press the
Search key on your phone if you have one. Type the name of an app in the
search field. You can search by keywords, but be sure to type complete
words, not just the first few letters of a word. Press Enter to begin your
search.
</p>
<p>
After your search, press Down to explore each of the results. To learn more
about any particular result, you can click on it. Clicking from this screen
will not start the download.
</p>
<p>
If doing a search appears to take you to a blank page, that just means there
were no search results. Go back and try a different search term.
</p>
<p>
After clicking on a result, you'll be on the Details page for a particular
app. There are two tabs across the top of this screen, About and Comments.
The Comments tab lets you read what other users say about this particular
app, but everything else is in the About tab. In the About tab, you'll
find more information about the app, and at the bottom, an Install button.
Click the Install button to continue.
</p>
<p>
The next screen is a confirmation screen. It shows you what features of your
phone this app will be able to access. Press the OK button at the bottom of
this screen to begin the download and automatic install.
</p>
<p>
Apps you download are installed automatically in the background while you
continue to use your phone. When you hear TalkBack announce that it has
returned to the search results page, you know your app is downloading.
You will get a notification when the app is installed. After you hear the
notification, you can go to the Notifications screen (in the Home screen
menu, or by swiping down from the top of the screen) and click on the
message that tells you the application installed to open it.
</p>
<div class="note">
Important note: on some apps, you might not be able to reach the Install
button by pressing Down, due to a bug. There are two workarounds: one is
to press the touch screen - the Install button is always at the bottom of
the screen. It's in the bottom-center if you're installing an app for the
first time, and at the bottom-left if you're installing an update. With
practice you can easily press in the required location.
Another workaround is to press Alt+Down when you first open the page,
which skips past the part of the page where the cursor gets stuck.
</div>

<h2>Paid apps</h2>

<p>
The Market supports Google Checkout for paid apps. If you wish to purchase
apps with a credit card, you should first set up Google Checkout from
your desktop computer by visiting <a href="http://google.com/checkout"
>http://google.com/checkout</a>. In addition, some mobile phone carriers
will let you purchase apps and charge them to your monthly phone bill, but
this may not be available on all carriers and in all regions.
</p>
<p>
The process for purchasing a paid app is almost exactly the same as a free
app. Instead of Install, you'll see a link that says Buy. After the
confirmation screen, you'll be on the Purchase Application page.
There's a control where you can select the payment method, and then a
button at the bottom that says <strong>Buy Now</strong> along with a
confirmation of the final purchase price.
</p>
<p>
Android Market apps can be returned for a full refund within 24 hours.
Go to the Download section of the Market to find an application you
don't like and uninstall it and get a refund.
</p>

<h2>Installing apps from sources other than the Market</h2>

<p>
The Android Market is a great way to find apps and quickly install them.
While the Market is open to just about anyone to publish any app, it is
managed by Google and does not allow malicious or dangerous apps.
However, you are not limited to using the Market to download apps and
there are often good reasons to install apps from a source other than
the Market: for example, sometimes developers post newer or experimental
versions of their software to their websites before they release them on
the Market. <strong>Spiel</strong>, one of the accessibility services
available for Android, is not currently available on the Market, for example.
</p>
<p>
To install a non-Market app, you'll need to enable installing non-Market
apps in the Settings, in the Application section. After you enable that
checkbox, visit the URL of the app you wish to download. If you know the
exact url, you can type it into the search box on the home screen or
directly into the address bar of the Browser. Even though the Browser is
not accessible, you can use it to access direct URLs.
</p>
<p>
An Android app is a file ending in the extension APK. After your APK file
has finished downloading, you'll get a notification. Click on the
notification and you'll be prompted to install the app if you want, just
like a Market app.
</p>
<p>
The Android Market will automatically notify you about Market apps that need to
be updated, but apps you install from a different source will need to be
updated to new versions manually.
