<h1>Android Accessibility</h1>

<p>
This is an introduction to using Android phones for people with low vision
or no vision who want their phone to speak.
</p>

<p>
All Android phones that have Android version 1.6 or later have built-in
support for speech output and accessibility, completely free. While not
all applications are accessible, Android is quite customizable. By downloading
the right software and configuring the phone properly, a visually-impaired user can access just about any function, including making phone calls, text messaging, email, web browsing, and downloading and using many of the thousands of apps on the Android market.
