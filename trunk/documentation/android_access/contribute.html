<h3>Share successes</h3>

<p>
One of the best ways to help other users is to share new examples of things
that do work: new Android phones that are accessible, new apps you've found
that are accessible, or tricks to work around accessibility problems.
We'd be happy to publish these here on this guide.
</p>

<h3>Labeling unlabeled objects</h3>

<p>
In the future we may provide ways for any user to provide labels for objects
that TalkBack or another accessibility service doesn't know how to describe.
For now, here are instructions that can be used by an advanced user who is
comfortable with a command-line shell on their desktop computer.
</p>

<ol>
<li>First enable USB debugging on your Android device,
    in Settings -> Application -> Development.
<li>Download the Android SDK onto your desktop computer.
<li>Open a command-line shell and find the <tt>adb</tt> program that comes
    with the Android SDK.
<li>Connect your Android device via USB and run "adb logcat".
<li>Navigate to the application you want to label and closely watch the
    logcat window. Immediately after focusing or selecting the object you
    want to label, find the AccessibilityEvent in the log. If there is no
    event, then this object can't be labeled. If there is, note the full
    details of the AccessibilityEvent along with the desired description.
<li>Send the resulting file to dmazzoni at google dot com to be included
    in the next release of TalkBack.
</ol>
