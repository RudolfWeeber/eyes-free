<p>As of October 2010, the default Android phone and contacts app is fully
usable with TalkBack. However, some devices have different contacts
applications developed by the manufacturer or carrier, and these apps may not
be as accessible. There are alternatives available on Market, one of which
we've listed below. There may be others out there - if you find one,
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/eyes-free/">let us know!</a> Also,
keep in mind that your contacts on Android sync with your contacts in the
GMail web interface, so you can also use a web browser to edit your
contacts.</p>

<h3 id="pr">Productivity</h3>
<p>The default Android Calendar is fully accessible as of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread).  On phones
with earlier versions of Android, the default Android Calendar is not fully usable with
TalkBack. The agenda view is somewhat accessible, and you can get notifications
on your phone. The weekly and monthly views are not accessible. Adding or
editing calendar entries on your phone is possible but a little tricky.</p>
<p>It works better to create calendar entries from your desktop computer and
then sync it to your device using Google Calendar. You can also try using the
<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/m">mobile version of Google
Calendar</a> on the web.</p>
