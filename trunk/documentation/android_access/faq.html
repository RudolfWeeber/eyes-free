<h3>Questions about what accessible Android phones can do:</h3>

<ul>

  <li><i>Which Android phones are accessible?</i>
  See <a href="phones.html">Choosing a Phone</a>.

  <li><i>Are there commands to read the whole screen or spell text
  one character at a time?</i> Currently, no.</li>

  <li><i>Is Email accessible?</i> The Gmail app is accessible, and the Email
  app is accessible as of Android 4.0. In previous versions, the built-in email
  app is not accessible, but there's an accessible email app you can download.
  See <a href="apps.html">Apps</a>.</li>

  <li><i>Is the web browser accessible?</i> Yes, as of Android 4.0. In previous
  versions, the built-in web browser is not accessible, but there's an
  accessible web browser you can download. See <a href="apps.html">Apps</a>.
  </li>

  <li><i>Is Android available in multiple languages?</i> Yes,
  the system already works in many languages, you can change it in the
  Settings. Each speech engine has support for a different set of
  languages for text-to-speech as well, but they're controlled
  independently of the system language.</li>

  <li><i>Is Android accessible if I don't have a physical
  keyboard?</i> Yes, as of Android 4.0. Previous versions can be made mostly
  accessible by installing and using the Eyes-Free Keyboard's virtual
  directional pad and talking keyboard, but some things (like menus and alert
  dialogs) will still be quite difficult or impossible to access.
  </li>

  <li><i>What about low-vision users?</i> There are some partial
  solutions, but Android does not have what is commonly known as a
  screen zoomer. Android 4.0 adds universal support for large font
  sizes.</li>

  <li><i>Does Android support braille?</i> Not yet.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Questions about how to use Android accessibility:</h3>

<ul>

  <li><i>How can I make it stop talking?</i> TalkBack uses the
  proximity sensor as a way to halt speech. Wave your hand slowly over
  the top of the phone, where you'd put your ear if you were on a
  phone call. It takes some practice to figure out the exact gesture
  for your phone, but once you learn it, it's easy and reliable.</li>

  <li><i>How can I safely restart TalkBack or Spiel without losing
  the ability to enable it again?</i>  Don't turn off
  Accessibility; when you turn it back on, it may not start
  TalkBack. Instead, turn off TalkBack and then click the screen in the
  same place turn it on again. Alternatively, you can reboot your device
  (turn it off and then on again). Your accessibility services will
  automatically start again.
  </li>

  <li><i>How do I get my contacts onto the phone?</i> Android automatically
  syncs with your Google contacts. If you already use Gmail, you use
  Google contacts. If not, you can easily import your address book from
  Outlook, Thunderbird, and many other email programs into Gmail.

  <li><i>How do I check the date, time, and battery status?</i>
  The battery status is available in Settings under About Phone.
  All of these are also available from the Eyes-Free Shell, or you can
  download many other apps for status information.

</ul>
