<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>
Android is designed to be mostly navigable with keys, without needing
to use the touch screen. So for the most part you won't be using
special commands that aren't available to other users: you'll be using
mostly the same keystrokes. The only difference is that you'll get
speech feedback instead of relying on seeing the screen to know what
you're doing.
</p>
<p>
Almost every Android phone has some type of directional controller:
most commonly a clickable trackball, arrow keys, or a directional
pad. You'll use that controller to move around and click on
things. Depending on what accessibility applications you've enabled,
you'll get speech, sound, and haptic (vibrational) feedback to tell you what
you've selected and what's happening on your phone.
</p>
<p>
There are three other keys that you will use frequently. Make sure you
know where these keys are on your phone:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>The <strong>Home</strong> button will take you to the home
  screen, where you can launch applications, open the notification
  panel, and much more. While Android comes with a home screen that's
  reasonably accessible, you can download other alternative apps to
  use as your home screen. In addition, if you press and hold the Home
  key, it will bring up a window that lets you switch to a recently
  opened app.

  <li>The <strong>Back</strong> button will take you back to the
  previous screen, whether in the same app or a different app. As an
  example, if you're reading an email, pressing Back might take you to
  your Inbox, pressing Back again might take you to your list of
  mailboxes, and pressing Back again yet might take you to your home
  screen. You can use Back to close most dialogs or exit most screens
  that are causing you problems.

  <li>The <strong>Menu</strong> button opens a menu specific to the
  current screen. Quite a bit of Android functionality is only
  possible if you open a menu, so be sure to check for it.  Menus are
  usually two-dimensional, so use the arrows to move up, down, left
  and right to find all of the options in the menu, and click one if
  you want. To close a menu, press Back.

</ul>

<h2>The home screen</h2>

<p>
There are a few very important items in the menu on the home screen:
Settings and Notifications. You may have already found the Settings,
that's where you enable accessibility. You'll find all sorts of other
useful customization options in Settings, and as soon as you have time
you should explore them and customize your phone. Notifications are
one of the primary ways that Android communicates messages to you
without interrupting you too much. Example notifications include new
mail, a new text message, or a low battery warning, but any app can
post a notification. When you have TalkBack or another accessibility
service running, it will speak the notification when it first appears,
but then whenever you want you can open the notifications from the
home screen menu to review all of your notifications. Most
notifications are clickable - when you click them they'll take you
directly to the message in question or tell you more information about
the warning.
</p>
<p>
The other most important thing on the home screen is the application
launcher. On older versions of Android it might be called "Sliding
Drawer", and on newer versions it's just called "All
Applications". When you click it, it opens a window of all of your
applications.
</p>
<p>
One thing that will be tricky at first is that this view is
two-dimensional, with four apps per row. In order to find all of your
apps, you'll need to explore all four apps in each horizontal row. If
this bothers you, you can install alternate home screens or app
launchers, such as the Eyes-Free shell.
</p>

<h2>Unlocking gesture</h2>

<p>
There are two scenarios where you may need to use the touch screen:
unlocking the phone after waking it up and answering a phone call. In
both cases, you just need to learn one simple gesture: while holding
the phone in its tall orientation, press your finger near the bottom
of the left side of the screen and swipe it all the way to the
right. To test this, first lock your phone by pressing the power
button once - TalkBack says Screen Off. Then press the power button
again and your screen will come on, but the phone will still be
locked. If you have KickBack running, you'll get feedback that helps
you find the handle you need to drag. Just keep touching the screen
until you feel the phone do a single quick vibrational bump.
When you feel it, hold your finger down and slide it to the right until
you get more feedback and the screen unlocks.
</p>

<h2>Making phone calls</h2>

<p>
This same gesture used to unlock is used to answer a call. To decline
a call, do the same gesture in reverse, from right to left. Of course,
some phones like the HTC G1 and LG Ally have Call Start and Call End
buttons, in which case you don't need these gestures.
</p>
<p>
If you don't like swiping to unlock your phone, you can disable this
or choose a different unlocking strategy. See 
<a href="customizing.html">Customizing</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
Ending a call is accessible, but if your phone doesn't have a physical
End Call button, doing so quickly without exploring the screen is more
of a challenge.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have Android 2.2 or later, there's a checkbox
in the Accessibility settings that makes the power button hang up
calls.
<li>If you have Android 2.1 or earlier,
you can try to learn where to press the touch-screen: it's in the
center, towards the bottom. Of course, you can always use your
directional pad to explore all of the buttons on the screen and click
the one to end the call.
</ul>
<p>
Everything else about phone calls is already accessible if your phone
has a keyboard: dialing, editing contacts, etc.
</p>
<p>
Now you know everything you need to start using your phone! The rest
of this guide will go into much more detail about some common things you
might want to do with your phone, and how to customize your experience
to work just right for you.
</p>
<p>
At this point, many of your questions may not be specific to
accessibility. If you want to learn how to make phone calls,
synchronize your contacts, play music, or more, you don't need a
special guide for accessibility. You can just read the manual that
came with your phone, or search the Internet for general advice on
using Android. In many cases, your experience may not be very
different than the experience for any other user.
