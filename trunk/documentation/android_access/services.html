<p>A number of <strong>Accessibility Services</strong> are available to aid
in navigating your Android device. Each can be enabled or disabled via the
Accessibility menu under Settings. The most popular services are described
below:</p>

<h2>TalkBack</h2>
<p><strong>TalkBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility services
provided by Google. It uses synthesized speech to describe the results of
<em>actions</em>, such as moving to a new control with the directional pad or
clicking on a control, and <em>events</em> such as a notification or incoming
call.</p>
<p>TalkBack comes preinstalled on most Android phones. However, it is under
active development. You may want to download the app from the Market to get the
latest features. Once you download it from the Market, you will be notified when
updates become available. Note that TalkBack cannot be uninstalled.</p>

<h2>Spiel</h2>
<p><strong>Spiel</strong> is a third-party accessibility service that
provides an alternative to TalkBack. It also uses synthesized speech to describe
actions and events, but it has its own rules for speaking that may differ from
TalkBack's. For more information on Spiel, see <a
  href="http://spielproject.info/">the Spiel Project webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Spiel is not available from the Android Market. To install Spiel, follow
the instructions in <a href="market">Market</a> to enable non-market apps.
Search for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/aspiel">http://tinyurl.com/aspiel</a> in
your browser. While the url will load in the browser which is not accessible, it
will automatically download the app. You can install it via the Notifications
screen.</p>
<p>You can have both TalkBack and Spiel installed at the same time, and then
enable whichever one you want to use. While it's perfectly safe to have both of
them enabled, only one of them will actually work at a time. Spiel and TalkBack
work very much the same way, so you shouldn't expect major differences. They're
both being actively developed independently.</p>

<h2>Voice Readouts</h2>
<p><strong>Voice Readouts</strong> is the Motorola accessibility service that
is analogous to TalkBack and Spiel. It also uses synthesized speech to
describe actions and events according to a set of rules.</p>
<p>Voice Readouts comes pre-installed on the Droid 2 and Droid X devices.
You can enable or disable it via the Accessibility menu under Settings.</p>

<h2>KickBack</h2>
<p><strong>KickBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility services
provided by Google. It provides haptic feedback by vibrating the device briefly
when you perform an action on the phone.</p>
<p>It can be especially useful when using the touch screen. The feedback
will inform you when you have found a valid control, like the slide-to-unlock
handle. Additionally, it can be useful when navigating your device using a
directional controller, as you know when your movement has resulted in an
action. For example, when navigating through a menu you will feel a bump every
time you hit a new menu item. When you stop receiving feedback, you know you
have reached the end of the list.</p>
<p>On devices running Android 4.0 and above, the functionality of KickBack is
included in TalkBack.</p>
<h2>SoundBack</h2>
<p><strong>SoundBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility services
provided by Google. It plays a short sound when you perform an action on the
phone, such as moving to a different control using the directional controller,
or clicking on a control that performs an action.</p>
<p>On devices running Android 4.0 and above, the functionality of SoundBack is
included in TalkBack.</p>

<h2>TTS Extended</h2>
<p>Android 2.2 includes a new capability for application developers to include
enhanced text-to-speech capabilities in their app. If you have Android 2.2, you
do not need to install anything.</p>
<p>If you have Android 2.1 or earlier, you can install an app called <strong>TTS
Extended</strong> to take advantaged of these enhanced capabilities in apps that 
use them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The various accessibility services are designed to complement one
another. While you should normally only use only one talking accessibility
service at time, the services that provide alternate feedback can be used
simultaneously for improved efficiency. While there can be a slight delay before
speech synthesis can talk after you perform an action, KickBack and SoundBack
can provide much more immediate feedback.</p>
