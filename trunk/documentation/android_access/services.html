<strong>TalkBack</strong> is just one of several <strong>Accessibility
Services</strong> that you can use on your Android device.  Here are
some more details about all of them:
</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>KickBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility
services provided by Google. It gives you haptic feedback by vibrating
the device briefly when you perform an action on the phone. It's especially
useful when using the touch screen, for example if you need to find the
slide-to-unlock handle, but it's also useful when navigating your
device using a directional controller, as you know when your movement has
resulted in an action. For example when navigating through a menu, you'll
feel a bump every time you hit a new menu item, but when you get to the
end, you'll stop getting the feedback.

<li><strong>SoundBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility
services provided by Google. It plays a short sound when you perform
an action on the phone, such as moving to a different control using
the directional controller, or clicking on a control that performs an
action.

<li><strong>TalkBack</strong> is one of the official accessibility
services provided by Google. It uses synthesized speech to describe
both <emph>actions</emph>, such as moving to a new control with the
directional pad or clicking on a control, and <emph>events</emph> such
as a notification or incoming call.

<li><strong>Spiel</strong> is a third-party accessibility service
written to be an alternative to TalkBack. It also uses synthesized
speech to describe actions and events, but it has its own rules for
speaking that may differ from TalkBack's. Spiel isn't currently
available on the Android market, but you can download it
from <a href="http://spielproject.info/"
>http://spielproject.info/</a>.

</ul>

<p>
The different accessibility services are designed to complement one
another. While you should normally only one talking accessibility service
at once, services that provide alternate feedback can be used simultaneously
for improved efficiency. While there's a slight delay before speech
synthesis can talk after you perform an action, KickBack and SoundBack are
much more immediate, making the user interface faster to navigate when
you're just trying to find the end of a list, for example.
