Having trouble pushing buttons while talking on the phone? If your
phone has a proximity sensor, be sure to move the phone away from your
face before trying to do something, including ending the call. The
proximity sensor is designed to keep you from pressing buttons by
accident with your face.
</p>
<p>
Phone is silent after you turn it on? It could be in the lock
screen. Press your Power key and you should hear feedback saying the
screen is going on or off. When the screen is on, but unlocked, swipe
your finger to unlock the screen.
<p>
Stuck? If you think you're on a screen with buttons or controls but
the directional controller has no effect when you move it in any
direction, here's what to do:
</p>
<p>
1. You might be focused on a control that's not accessible, like a big
scrolling list of terms of service - but there still might be something
else accessible on the screen. Try going down a lot to get past the current
control.
</p>
<p>
2.Sometimes, nothing on the screen is focused at all, but you can
fix it by touching the screen with your finger. Be careful of tapping,
which could click on a button that you don't want to press. Instead,
try slowly swiping the screen with a diagonal motion from corner to
corner, then move your directional controller. This usually gets you
un-stuck and focuses a control.
</p>
<p>
3. Finally, you might be on a screen that's not accessible at all.  As
an example, if you did a search on the Market, the "no results found"
screen won't read anything, so in this case you'd just want to go
back.

If you're still having trouble, the best resource is to join and post messages
to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/eyes-free/">eyes-free
mailing list.</a> Remember to tell people what phone you're using and
what Android version it has.
