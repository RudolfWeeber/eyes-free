<p><em>Having trouble pushing buttons while talking on the phone?</em> If
your phone has a proximity sensor, be sure to move the phone away from your face
before trying to do something, including ending the call. The proximity sensor
is designed to keep you from pressing buttons by accident with your face.</p>
<p><em>Phone is silent after you turn it on?</em> It could be in the lock
screen. Press your Power key and you should hear feedback saying the screen is
going on or off. When the screen is on, but unlocked, swipe your finger to
unlock the screen.
<p><em>Unable to navigate?</em> If you think you're on a screen with buttons
or controls but the directional controller has no effect when you move it in any
direction, here's what to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You might be focused on a control that's not accessible, like a big
  scrolling list of terms of service - but there still might be something else
  accessible on the screen. Try going down a lot to get past the current
  control.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, nothing on the screen is focused at all, but you can fix
  it by touching the screen with your finger. Be careful of tapping, which could
  click on a button that you don't want to press. Instead, try slowly swiping
  the screen with a diagonal motion from corner to corner, then move your
  directional controller. This usually gets you un-stuck and focuses a control.
  </li>
  <li>Finally, you might be on a screen that's not accessible at all. As an
  example, if you did a search on the Market, the "no results found" screen
  won't read anything, so in this case you'd just want to go back.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're still having trouble, the best resource is to join and post
messages to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/eyes-free/">eyes-free
mailing list.</a> Remember to tell people what phone you're using and what 
Android version it has.</p>
