<p>
<strong>Default apps</strong>:
When you install multiple apps that fulfill the same role, such as
multiple home screens or multiple web browsers, then Android might
sometimes ask you which app you want to open. For example, when you
press the Home button, but you have two Home screen apps, it will ask
you which one you want. There's also a checkbox where you can set that
app as the default, so it won't ask you again. The other app will
still be there, but it won't open unless you specifically open it
yourself. To reset the defaults, just open Settings, Application
settings, Manage Applications, and click on the application that's the
default now, and you'll get an option to make it not the default
anymore.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Shortcuts</strong>:
You can assign Search key + any letter on your keyboard to opening an
app of your choice. It's in Settings, under the Applications section.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Toggle silent mode in the lock screen</strong>:
When your phone is locked, you use a swipe gesture from left to right to
unlock it. If you swipe from right to left, you can toggle silent mode
on and off. TalkBack will announce the mode change if you do this
successfully.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Turn off features you don't need</strong>:
If you're not going to be using the display, you can save battery by
reducing the brightness to the lowest setting and turning off animations.
You can find both of these in the Display section of Settings.
You may also want to turn off auto-rotating the screen.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TTS Extended lets you access advanced TTS features on older
Android versions</strong>:
You shouldn't download this if you have Android 2.2 or later. But if you
have Android 2.1 or earlier, TTS Extended will allow many applications to
speak using additional voices other than the built-in voice, and it gives
you more options for controlling speech.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Music app is accessible</strong>:
When playing a song, either click or press the spacebar to play or pause.
To skip to another track, press left or right. To seek within a track,
hold down the left or right keys.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sliders are not very accessible</strong>:
If you encounter a slider or seek control, unfortunately it's not
accessible. This is a known bug that will be fixed in a future version of
Android. However, the control does actually move if you press the left or
right arrows, there's just no way to get feedback as to the current
position. Still, if it's very important to adjust something, you can always
manipulate it blind and check to see if it had an effect some other way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Turn off Gmail syncing if you don't need it</strong>:
Since Gmail isn't accessible, there's no need to sync it. Go to the Accounts
&amp; Sync section in the Settings to stop syncing your Gmail email. You
may want to keep syncing contacts and other Google data, though, since those
are accessible. Note that you can still read your email from Gmail using
a different accessible email program - you just can't use the built-in
Gmail-only app.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Many apps have tabs across the top of the screen</strong>:
Don't forget to check the two-dimensional layout of the screen as you're
exploring.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Android has several keyboard shortcuts</strong>:
Many of the text-editing keystrokes you're used to in a desktop computer
will work on an Android device with a keyboard. For example, hold down
Shift while moving the directional controller to select text, and press
Alt+X to cut, Alt+C to copy, and Alt+V to paste in any text box. In addition,
press Alt+Up to move to the top of a box and Alt+Down to move to the bottom.
This also works in lists, not just in text boxes.
