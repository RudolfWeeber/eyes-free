There are more than 50 phones worldwide that run versions of the
Android operating system. We will list a few of the more popular
models below, but here are the most important things to know before
choosing an accessible phone:
</p>

<p>
1. <strong>Android version</strong>. Each phone comes with a
particular version of the Android operating system, and while many
phones will be upgraded by a carrier later, it's usually impossible to
know exactly when a particular phone will get an upgrade, so you
should plan on getting a phone that has the features you will be happy
with for a long time just in case. Android version 1.6 was the first
version with accessibility support. Android 2.0 was a substantial
improvement. The latest release is version 2.2, but as of July 2010,
most people consider a phone running Android 2.1 to be reasonably
current.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you'll hear Android versions called by their code names,
which are always names of desserts starting with a successive letter
of the alphabet. Here's a quick guide:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> Android 1.5: Cupcake
  <li> Android 1.6: Donut
  <li> Android 2.0 or 2.1: Eclair
  <li> Android 2.2: Froyo (short for frozen yogurt)
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For more information about what accessibility features were introduced in each version,
see the <a href="versions.html">Android Version Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
2. <strong>Keyboard and tactile buttons.</strong> Some Android phones
have physical keyboards and others do not. In addition, some phones
have more tactile buttons than others, making it easier to perform
certain actions without touch-screen controls. Here are all of the
physical buttons that you might find on an Android phone:

<ul>
  <li> Start call
  <li> End call
  <li> Back
  <li> Menu
  <li> Home
  <li> Search
  <li> Camera
  <li> Volume up / down
  <li> Power
  <li> Directional pad or trackball and select button
  <li> QWERTY keyboard
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Some phones have a physical, tactile control for every one of these
functions, others have no tactile controls at all. The best way to
determine if a phone is best for you is to try one out, but if that's
impossible, you can look at specs online and find a phone that has the
keys that matter the most to you.
</p>

<p>
Some phones have touch keys, also called capacitive keys. These keys
are invisible and feel like they're part of the screen, but they're
separate discrete regions. The phone gives you haptic (vibrational)
feedback when you press one of these keys successfully, but it can be
hard to position your finger in the right place before you get the
feedback. Some people put a small piece of tape over them to make them
more tactile.
</p>

<h2>Known-accessible Android phones with keyboards</h2>

<p>
Here are the best phones for accessibility - all of these have full
QWERTY keyboards and are known to work well:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>LG Ally</strong> (Android 2.1) has a slide-out tactile
keyboard with large raised keys that are very easy to type on. It has
tactile buttons for on the front for start call, home, menu, and end
call, plus touch keys for back and search. When you slide out the
keyboard, you get a four-direction pad and center select button, plus
every key you would ever need. It has every key mentioned above. The
phone is moderately fast and powerful. In the U.S., this is available
on Verizon.
</li>

<li><strong>Motorola Droid / Milestone</strong> (Android 2.2) has a
slide-out tactile keyboard, though the keys are very flat and not as
easy to find by touch. The slide-out keyboard has a four-direction pad
and center select button, plus search and menu buttons, in addition to
the alphanumeric keys. The front has just four touch buttons for back,
menu, home, and search. The phone is very fast and powerful.
In the U.S., this is available on Verizon.
</li>

<li><strong>HTC Dream / HTC G1</strong> (Android 1.6) has a slide-out
tactile keyboard with thin but easy to find keys. The slide-out
keyboard has menu and search keys, and the front has menu, home, back,
call start, and call end buttons, plus a clickable trackball. The
trackball can access every thing that a directional pad can, but it
can be difficult to move it precisely without being able to see the
screen. This is a first-generation phone, and it is slower and less
powerful than most newer phones. It is not expected to be upgraded to
Android 2.0, ever, but accessibility does work on Android 1.6.
In the U.S., this is available on T-Mobile.
</li>

</ul>
