<p>There are more than 50 phones worldwide (as of August 2010) that run
versions of the Android operating system. We will list a few of the more
popular models below, but here are the most important things to know before
choosing an accessible phone:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Android version</strong>. Each phone comes with a particular
version of the Android operating system. While the operating system version can
be upgraded at a later date, it is up to the individual carriers to make such
updates available. Since it is hard to predict when these updates will occur,
you should plan on purchasing a phone that already has features that you will
be happy with. The following is a list of available Android versions.</p>

<p>Android versions are sometimes referred to by their code names, which are
generally names of desserts starting with a successive letter of the
alphabet.</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Android 1.5: Cupcake
  <li>Android 1.6: Donut
  <li>Android 2.0 or 2.1: Eclair
  <li>Android 2.2: Froyo (short for frozen yogurt)
  <li>Android 2.3: Gingerbread
  <li>Android 3.1: Honeycomb
  <li>Android 4.0: Ice Cream Sandwich
</ul>
</p>

<p>Android 1.6 was the first version with accessibility support. Support was
substantially improved in Android 2.0, and support for touchscreen-only devices
was added in Android 4.0 For more information about what accessibility features
were introduced in each version, see the <a href="versions.html">Android
Version Guide</a>.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="n">Important note: </span><p>Carriers and device
manufacturers will sometimes create customized versions of the Android
operating system. For example, HTC often ships phones that include a custom
user interface called HTC Sense. Unfortunately, there is <strong>no
guarantee</strong> that devices with customized Android operating systems
include accessibility support. </p>
<p>If you are wondering whether a particular device includes support for
accessibility, you can check the list below. If the phone isn't listed there,
it is best to check with the carrier or device manufacturer. Also, Wikipedia
has a fairly comprehensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_devices">list of Android devices</a> including information on
the version number and whether or not there is a keyboard.</p>
<p>And be aware that even if a phone running a custom version of Android does
include accessibility, the operating system may still have been altered
enough that specific instructions in this guide may still not apply.</p></div>

<p>2. <strong>Keyboard and tactile buttons.</strong> Android phones come in
a variety of different physical configurations. A physical QWERTY keyboard and
other tactile buttons can make it easier to perform certain actions without
using touch-screen controls. The following is a list of physical buttons that
you might find on an Android phone:

<ul>
  <li>Start call
  <li>End call
  <li>Back
  <li>Menu
  <li>Home
  <li>Search
  <li>Camera
  <li>Volume up / down
  <li>Power
  <li>Directional pad or trackball and select button
  <li>QWERTY keyboard
</ul>
</p>

<p>The number of physical, tactile controls varies significantly by phone
model. We recommend that you try out a phone at your local store to determine
if it works well for you. If that is impossible, you can find detailed specs
online and find a phone that has the keys that matter the most to you.</p>

<p>Some phones have touch keys, also known as capacitive keys. These keys are
invisible and feel like they're part of the screen, but they're actually
separate, discrete regions. The phone gives you haptic (vibrational) feedback
when you press one of these keys successfully, but it can be hard to position
your finger in the right place before you get the feedback. Some people put a
small piece of tape over the keys to make them more tactile.</p>

<h2>Known-accessible Android phones with "Explore by touch" (as of December
    2011)</h2>

<p>The following devices run Android 4.0 or above and are touchscreen-accessible
   via the "Explore by touch" feature.</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Galaxy Nexus</strong> (Android 4.0)
    <ul>
      <li>The first Android device with "Explore by touch" for accessible use
          without a hardware keyboard.</li>
      <li>Has only three tactile buttons (power, volume up, and volume down).
          The Back, Home, Recent Apps, and Menu buttons appear at the bottom of
          the touchscreen and are touch explorable.</li>
      <li>On-screen keyboard is touch explorable.</li>
      <li>Very fast and powerful.</li>
      <li>In the U.S., available on Verizon.</li>
    </li>
  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Known-accessible Android phones with keyboards (as of August 2010)</h2>

<p>The following devices are our top recommendations for accessible phones.
All have full QWERTY keyboards and are known to work well. For each device
we've included a description of the physical tactile buttons and any touch
(capacitive) buttons and their locations on the device.</p>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li><div class="note"><span class="n">Please note:</span> Though this
      phone is running the standard Android 2.2 operating system and includes
      accessibility support, it does not come with TalkBack pre-installed. You
      will have to install TalkBack from the Android Market yourself. You will
      be guided through this process if you go to the Accessibility menu in the
      Settings. For more information on this process, see the section on
      <a href="enabling.html">Enabling Accessibility</a>.</div></li>
