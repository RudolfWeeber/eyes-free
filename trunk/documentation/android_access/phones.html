<p>There are more than 50 phones worldwide (as of August 2010) that run
versions of the Android operating system. We will list a few of the more
popular models below, but here are the most important things to know before
choosing an accessible phone:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Android version</strong>. Each phone comes with a particular
version of the Android operating system. While the operating system version can
be upgraded at a later date, it is up to the individual carriers to make such
updates available. Since it is hard to predict when these updates will occur,
you should plan on purchasing a phone that already has features that you will
be happy with. The following is a list of available Android versions.</p>

<p>Android versions are sometimes referred to by their code names, which are
generally names of desserts starting with a successive letter of the
alphabet.</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Android 1.5: Cupcake
  <li>Android 1.6: Donut
  <li>Android 2.0 or 2.1: Eclair
  <li>Android 2.2: Froyo (short for frozen yogurt)
</ul>
</p>

<p>Android 1.6 was the first version with accessibility support. Support was
substantially improved in Android 2.0. For more information about what
accessibility features were introduced in each version, see the <a
  href="versions.html">Android Version Guide</a>.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="n">Important note: </span><p>Carriers and device
manufacturers will sometimes create customized versions of the Android
operating system. For example, HTC often ships phones that include a custom
user interface called HTC Sense. Unfortunately, there is <strong>no
guarantee</strong> that devices with customized Android operating systems
include accessibility support. </p>
<p>If you are wondering whether a particular device includes support for
accessibility, you can check the list below. If the phone isn't listed there,
it is best to check with the carrier or device manufacturer.</p>
<p>And be aware that even if a phone running a custom version of Android does
include accessibility, the operating system may still have been altered
enough that specific instructions in this guide may still not apply.</p></div>

<p>2. <strong>Keyboard and tactile buttons.</strong> Android phones come in
a variety of different physical configurations. A physical QWERTY keyboard and
other tactile buttons can make it easier to perform certain actions without
using touch-screen controls. The following is a list of physical buttons that
you might find on an Android phone:

<ul>
  <li>Start call
  <li>End call
  <li>Back
  <li>Menu
  <li>Home
  <li>Search
  <li>Camera
  <li>Volume up / down
  <li>Power
  <li>Directional pad or trackball and select button
  <li>QWERTY keyboard
</ul>
</p>

<p>The number of physical, tactile controls varies significantly by phone
model. We recommend that you try out a phone at your local store to determine if it works well for you. If that is impossible, you can find detailed specs
online and find a phone that has the keys that matter the most to you.</p>

<p>Some phones have touch keys, also known as capacitive keys. These keys are
invisible and feel like they're part of the screen, but they're actually
separate, discrete regions. The phone gives you haptic (vibrational) feedback
when you press one of these keys successfully, but it can be hard to position
your finger in the right place before you get the feedback. Some people put a
small piece of tape over the keys to make them more tactile.</p>

<h2>Known-accessible Android phones with keyboards (as of August 2010)</h2>

<p>The following devices are our top recommendations for accessible phones.
All have full QWERTY keyboards and are known to work well. For each device
we've included a description of the physical tactile buttons and any touch
(capacitive) buttons and their locations on the device.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LG Ally</strong> (Android 2.1)
   <ul>
     <li>Tactile buttons on the front for start call,
     home, menu, and end call. There are touch keys above those for back and
     search.</li>
     <li>Slide-out tactile keyboard with large raised keys that are very easy
     to type on.</li>
     <li>When you slide out the keyboard, you get a QWERTY keyboard, a
     four-direction pad with a select button in the center, and tactile
     buttons for back, home, menu, and search.</li>
     <li>Includes a dedicated number row at the top of the alphanumeric
     keys.</li>
     <li>Includes every physical button mentioned in the section above. The
     volume rocker and camera buttons are physical buttons located on the
     sides of the phone. The power button is located along the top edge.</li>
     <li>Moderately fast and powerful.</li>
     <li>In the U.S., this is available on Verizon.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

  <li><strong>Motorola Droid (US) / Milestone (Europe)</strong> (Android
  2.2)
    <ul>
      <li>Four large touch buttons in a row below the screen for back, menu,
      home, and search.</li>
      <li>Slide-out tactile keyboard, though the keys are very flat and not
      very easy to find by touch.</li>
      <li>The slide-out keyboard has a QWERTY keyboard, a four-direction pad
      with a select button in the center, and tactile buttons for search and
      menu. The four-direction pad is almost flush with the keyboard surface
      and can be difficult to use.</li>
      <li>There is no dedicated number row at the top of the alphanumeric
      keys. To type numbers, you have to put the keyboard in symbol mode</li>
      <li>Does not have a start or end call button. However, you have the
      option to use the power button as the end call button. You can activate
      this option in the settings menu.</li>
      <li>The volume rocker and camera buttons are physical buttons located
      on the right side of the phone. The power button is located along the
      top edge.
      <li>The phone is very fast and powerful.</li>
      <li>In the U.S., this is available on Verizon.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

    <ul>
      <li><div class="note"><span class="n">Please note:</span> that this
      phone runs a customized version of Android 2.2. However, this phone does
      include support for accessibility, and Motorola has even included a few
      applications targeted for users with low or no vision. But keep in mind
      that not all applications bundled with this phone by the carrier or
      Motorola are accessible. For more information on accessible
      applications, please see the <a href="apps.html"> the section on
      apps</a>.</div></li>
      <li>Four small touch buttons in a row below the screen for menu, home,
      back, and search.</li>
      <li>Slide-out tactile keyboard with raised keys.</li>
      <li>The keyboard features PC-style tactile arrow keys and a
      separate OK button. These keys replace the flat four-direction pad on
      the original Droid.</li>
      <li>The keyboard includes tactile buttons for search and
      back. It also includes a special microphone tactile button that
      triggers a custom Motorola voice search application.</li>
      <li>There is no dedicated number row at the top of the
      alphanumeric keys. To type numbers, you have to put the keyboard in
      symbol mode.</li>

      the option to use the power button as the end call button. You can
      activate this option in the settings menu.</li>

      <li>In the U.S., this is available on Verizon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>HTC Dream / HTC G1</strong> (Android 1.6)
    <ul>
      <li><div class="note"><span class="n">Please note: </span>This is a
      first-generation phone, and it is slower and less powerful than most
      newer phones. Though is not expected to ever be upgraded to Android 2.0,
      basic accessibility features do work on Android 1.6.</div></li>
      <li>Four round tactile buttons and a clickable trackball in a row below
      the screen: start call, home, trackball, back, and end call. There is
      also a rectangular tactile menu botton located above the trackball. When
      held down, the end call button functions as the power on/off button.</li>
      <li>The trackball can access everything that a directional pad can, but
      it can be difficult to move it precisely without being able to see the
      screen.</li>
      <li>Slide-out tactile keyboard with thin but raised keys.</li>
      <li>The keyboard includes a QWERTY keyboard and tactile menu and search
      keys.</li>
      <li>Includes a dedicated number row at the top of the alphanumeric
      keys.</li>

      as the end call button.</li>
      <li>In the U.S., this is available on T-Mobile.</li>
