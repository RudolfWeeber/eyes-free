* Android Eyes-Free Video Demos

This directory contains descriptions of videos demonstrating the
use of the various applications that make up Project Eyes-Free
for Android. For each video found on channel [[http://www.youtube.com/user/EyesFreeAndroid][ EyesFreeAndroid]] on
YouTube,  there is an accompanying text file that is the script
used to prepare the video --- these also make up high-quality
text transcripts for those not able to listen to the audio. Users
wishing to appreciate these videos without looking at the screen
can rest assured that the audio content, in conjunction with the
text scripts together ensure that one misses nothing substantive
by not viewing the visual component.



  1. [[./01-intro.html][Introduction]] Gives a high-level overview of Project
     Eyes-Free and its goal of turning Android into an  eyes-free
     communication device supporting one-handed, single-touch interaction.
  2. [[./02-strokes.html][Stroke Dialing]] Demonstrates the stroke dialer, a key
     component of eyes-free interaction on Android. It differs
     from traditional on-screen keyboards in that it uses
     /relative positioning/ rather than /absolute positioning/
     --- this enables eyes-free use. This dialing technique is
     used across a wide variety of applications.
  3. [[./03-phone.html][Talking Dialer ]] Demonstrates using Android as
     a   communication  device for fluent, eyes-free
     interaction. Concludes with a teaser --- talking phonebook.
  4. [[./04-phonebook.html][Talking Phonebook]] Demonstrates how we use strokes for rapid
     access to contacts in the phone book.
  5. [[./05-eyes-free-home.html][Eyes-Free Shell]] Demonstrates the /Home/ screen that supports
     eyes-free access to oft-used tasks. Uses stroke dialer for
     rapid access. This video also Demonstrates useful talking
     mini-applications that provide single-touch access to useful
     information.
  6. [[./06-marvin-access.html][Marvin And Accessibility]] connects the dots while giving a
     first glimpse at the new Android Access tools in
     Android-1.6. Discusses how eyes-free applications from
     Marvin work hand-in-hand with a built-in screenreader to
     provide efficient eyes-free interaction.
  7. [[./07-accessible.html][Introducing Android Access]] briefly reviews the newly
     introduced accessibility framework and describes what this
     means for end-users and developers.
  8.    [[./08-talkback.html][TalkBack]]  demonstrates using the TalkBack screenreader
     --- an Open Source tool that runs in the background to turn
     native Android applications into talking applications. Shows
     use of the Android Alarm-clock application.
  9.  [[./09-maps.html][Demonstrates using TalkBack with the Google Maps application.]]
