*Video: Connecting  The Dots: Marvin And Android Access 

When we first launched project eyes-free in early spring 2009, we
promised to post frequent video updates to the eyes-free
channel. Well, sadly, we have been remiss in keeping that promise
--- but all in a good cause --- we were busy building out the
needed accessibility APIs in the core Android framework.

We're now returning with a fresh set of video updates that
demonstrate   the new accessibility framework in Android, and how
these access related tools mesh with the Eyes-Free shell  shown
earlier.

To summarize:

  1. All of the eyes-free utilities from project Marvin continue
     to be developed in order to provide fluent eyes-free interaction.
  2. The Marvin shell that we demonstrated last time continues to
     be my default home screen.
  3. We have added an application launcher on the Marvin screen
     that can be launched by stroking _8_.
  4. This launcher uses stroke dialing to quickly navigate and
     launch applications.
  5. With the launch of the Accessibility API  in Android
     1.6, and the accompanying Open Source TalkBack screenreader,
     I can now launch *any* Android application, e.g., Google
     Maps or YouTube.
  6.  TalkBack provides spoken feedback for native Android
      applications, including the settings menu.
  7. You can use Android Market to install third-party
     applications, many of these work *outof the box* with TalkBack.

We'll demonstrate these, and a variety of other new cool
enhancements in these forthcoming videos, stay tuned!
