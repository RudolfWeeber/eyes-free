* [[./06-mini-apps.html][Video: Talking Mini-Applications For Single Touch Access]]

Here, we demonstrate some of the talking mini-applications that
can be accessed from the Marvin screen.
All of these mini-applications speak useful information without
the need for the user to do some form of /context switch/.



** Device State

Available from _1_ on the Marvin screen, this mini-application
announces useful information such as signal strength, and
availability of WiFi networks.

** Date And Time

Available on _2_ on the Marvin screen, this mini-application provides single-touch access to current
date and time.


** Battery State And Power

Pressing _3_ on the Marvin screen speaks the current battery
level and announces if the phone is presently being charged.


** Knowing Your Location 

Available as _6_ from the Marvin home screen,
this mini-application announces your present location based on
information acquired via GPS and the cell network. It speaks your
current heading using the built-in magnetic compass, looks up the
current location on Google Maps, and announces the location in
terms of a nearby address and street intersection.
