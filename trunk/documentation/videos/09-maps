*Video: TalkBack And Google Maps 

TalkBack provides spoken feedback as you use Google Maps.
In this video, we will demonstrate typical maps tasks such as:

  
     1. Launch Google Maps using the Marvin application launcher.
     2. From within the Maps application, press the _menu_ key.
     3. Select /Search/ and type a query into the search field.
     4. Notice that I can type a partial query and have
        auto-completion based on previous searches.
     5. Press _Enter_ to perform the search.
     6. Bring up the result list in /ListView/ by touching the
        bottom left of the screen.
     7. Scroll through this list using the track ball.
     8. Click with the trackball to select a business.
     9. Scroll through available options, and click /Get Directions/.
     10.Click the /Go/ button to get directions.
     11. Scroll with the trackball to hear  the directions spoken.
In addition, you can also use Google Latitude to locate your
friends.

Note that other Map tools such as Google Latitude are accessible
from within the set of options that appear when you press the
_menu_ key.
