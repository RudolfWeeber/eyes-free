*Video: Introducing TalkBack, An Open Source Screenreader 



We briefly introduced TalkBack in the previous video while enabling /Accessibility/ from the settings menu.
Here, we show off some of this screenreader's features.

TalkBack is designed to be a simple, non-obtrusive
screenreader. What this means in practice is that you interact
directly with your applications, and not with
TalkBack. TalkBack's job is to remain in the background and
provide the spoken feedback that you need.

TalkBack works with all of Android's native user interface
controls. This means you can configure all aspects of the Android
user interface with TalkBack providing appropriate spoken
feedback. What is more, you can use most native Android
applications --- including those downloaded from the Android
Market with TalkBack providing spoken feedback.

Here are some examples of Android applications (both from Google as well as third-party applications available onmarket) that  work with TalkBack:


  - Google Maps: Perform searches, and listen to directions.
  - YouTube: Search, browse categories and play.
  - Simple Weather: Listen to local weather forecasts.
  - Facebook: Moving around on the social Web.

But in this video, we'll demonstrate the use of a very simple but
useful Android application --- the Android Alarm clock.

  -  Launch: I launch the alarm clock from  Marvin's eyes-free application launcher.
  - TalkBack: TalkBack takes over and starts speaking.
  - Navigate: Navigating  with the trackball speaks the alarm
    under focus.
  - Activate: Activating with the trackball produces appropriate feedback.
  - Navigate: Selected alarm displays its settings in a list-view which speaks as we navigate.
