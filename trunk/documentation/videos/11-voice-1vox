*Video: 1Vox --- Your Query Is Our Command!


Speech interface designers often express surprize at the the fact
that the average blind user rarely if ever uses spoken input. But
when you come down to it, this is not too surprizing --- given
that the eyes-free user has speech output active, the  overall system ends up talking to itself!

To show that these conflicts can be avoided by careful user-interface design,
we  demonstrate 1Vox --- our voice-search wizard for the Marvin Shell.

  1. You activate 1Vox by  stroke _9_ on the Marvin screen.
  2. You hear a spoekn prompt /Search/
  3. You hear a little auditory icon when  the system is ready
     for you.
  4. You speak oft-used queries e.g., /Weather Mountain View/.
  5. You hear a short spoken snippet in response.

We called this widget 1Vox --- in honor of the Google onebox  found
on the  Google Results page.
