* [[http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdozYBEp8Ays][Video: Introducing Project Eyes-Free  For Android]]

Project Eyes-Free turns your Android into an eyes-free
communication device with one-handed, single-touch access to
common tasks. Applications from this project can be used
stand-alone; they can also be used together through the Eyes-Free
shell. This collection of videos will cover the latter scenario.


We will refer to the eyes-free shell as /Marvin/ in honor of
Douglas Adams' famous paranoid android
--- our Marvin says 
:Brain the size of a planet and they expect me to make phone calls?
The Marvin home screen 
provides single-touch access to useful information via a
collection of talking mini-applications. In addition,  commonly
used applications can be placed under /shortcuts/ for quick
access. Finally, the /call/ button automatically launches the
eyes-free /Talking Dialer/ --- all of these applications are
covered in detail in subsequent videos.
