So now, let's use the stroke dialer for something practical ---
let's make phone calls with our smart phone!
Well, we know Marvin would disapprove if we /just/ made phone
calls, so rest assured, we'll do a lot more later!

Pressing the _call_ button on Android phones launches the
built-in dialing application. When using the Marvin shell,
pressing this button launches the /Talking Dialer/ application
--- if you are not using Marvin as your home screen, you can
launch this dialer as you would launch any Android application.

The /Talking Dialer/ announces _dialing mode_ upon start up.
You can start dialing using the technique  described in the
[[./02-strokes.html][previous video on stroke dialer]] --- if you make a mistake, simply
shake the phone to erase. Once you have finished dialing, press
the _call_ button to initiate the call. The application speaks
the number you're about to dial, and makes the call once you
press the _call_ button to confirm.
But you say 
:Dialing phone numbers is so passe'!

--- well, there is still hope for the /Talking Dialer/. In
addition to _dialing mode_, the /Talking Dialer/ provides an easy
to use /Talking Phonebook/ that provides eyes-free access to your
contact list --- we will cover this in our [[./04-phonebook.html][video on the talking
phonebook]].
