*Video: Introducing The Android Accessibility Framework


Starting with Android 1.6 --- fondly known as Donut ---the
platform includes an Accessibility API that makes it easy to
implement adaptive technology such as screenreaders. Android 1.6
comes with a built-in screenreader called TalkBack that provides
spoken feedback when using Android applications written in Java.

The next few videos will progressively introduce TalkBack,
SoundBack and KickBack, a suite of programs that augment the
Android user interface with alternative output. 

All of these special utilities are available through option
/Accessibility/ in the Android Settings menu. Once activated, the
accessibility settings are persistent across reboots, i.e., you
need enable these tools only once.


Notice that because I have accessibility  enabled on my phone,
all user actions produce relevant auditory feedback. Thus, each
item is spoken as I
move through the various options in the settings menu. The spoken
feedback also indicates the state of an item as appropriate.

Activating SoundBack produces non-spoken auditory feedback;
KickBack produces haptic feedback.
