Building TalkBack from the command line using Ant
-------------------------------------------------

To get started with Ant, first make sure you have the latest version of Ant 
installed. If not:

sudo apt-get install ant1.8

The default version on Linux is 1.7, which is too old for the latest Android 
SDK. 

First, you'll need to have screenmagnifier and utils checked out from marvin.
Next, generate the required build scripts with the Android tools.

From the utils directory, run:

android update project --path . --target android-4 --name utils

From the screenmagnifier directory, run:

android update project --path . --target android-14 --name screenmagnifier

From the talkback directory, run:

android update project --path . --target android-14 --name talkback

This will create or update some default build files for Android. These are
build.xml, project.properties, and local.properties. Now you can build an
unsigned TalkBack APK by running:

ant release

The resulting APK can be found at bin/Talkback-unsigned.apk, ready to be 
signed, zipaligned, and installed on a phone.
