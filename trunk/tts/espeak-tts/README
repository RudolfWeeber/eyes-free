This project contains tools for compiling the eSpeak library for use on the
Android platform. It contains an Eclipse Android application project that
provides a Java API for accessing the natively-compiled eSpeak API and a
text-to-speech service that uses the API.

NOTE: You must download and extract source files for the eSpeak library
prior to building this project.
