This project was branched from Android 2.3's Latin IME package. It has been
modified to exist in the com.googlecode.eyesfree namespace and to support
Android's built-in accessibility features.

**IMPORTANT**
To build this project's APK, you must first build its native libraries:
  1. Install Android NDK r4 or greater
  2. Run ndk-build from the project directory
  3. (Eclipse only) Refresh the project's libs folder

To regenerate this projects's ant build files, run:
  android update project --name latinime --target android-8 --path <project-path>

To clone the current Latin IME tree, install git, and run:
git clone git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME.git
