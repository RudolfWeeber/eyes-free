Building TalkBack from the command line using Ant
-------------------------------------------------

To get started with Ant, first make sure you have the latest version of Ant 
installed. If not:

sudo apt-get install ant1.8

The default version on Linux is 1.7, which is too old for the latest Android 
SDK. 

First, you'll need to have utils, compatutils, and widgets/radial-menu checked
out from marvin. Next, generate the required build scripts with the Android
tools.

From the utils directory, run:

android update project --path .

From the compatutils directory, run:

android update project --path .

From the widgets/radial-menu directory, run:

android update project --path .

From the talkback directory, run:

android update project --path .

This will create or update some default build files for Android. These are
build.xml, project.properties, and local.properties. Now you can build an
unsigned TalkBack APK by running:

ant release

The resulting APK can be found at bin/talkback-unsigned.apk, ready to be
signed, zipaligned, and installed on a phone.


Generating references to resources in raw/*.xml
-----------------------------------------------

Extract the resource references from the XML files:
  cat *.xml | grep -o '@[a-z_]*/[a-z_]*' >> RawReferences.java

Remove duplicates from the resulting file:
  (R\.\w+\.\w+)((,\n\s+R\.\w+\.\w+)*),\n\s+\1 ==> \1\2
